### Running the Executables

- Use command 'make' to create executables
- Use command 'cd tcp' to enter directory with executables
- To use client (sender), use command './sender [Host IP] [Port Num] [File Name/Directory]'
- To use server (receiver), use command './Server/receiver [Port Num] [File Name]'
- After finishing, call 'make clean' to remove 'tcp' folder
